                Passage You want to hit a small box on the floor with a
                marble fired from a spring-loaded gun that is mounted
                on a table. The target box is a distance R horizontally
                from the edge of the table; see the figure to the right.
                You compress the spring a distance d, but the center of
                the marble falls short by a distance r of the center of the
                box. How far should you compress the spring to score a
                direct hit (neglect friction)?
